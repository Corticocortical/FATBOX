# FATBOX
The FMRI Analysis Toolbox

The FATBOX (FMRI Analysis Toolbox) is a MATLAB and bash toolbox designed to simplify the analysis of fMRI data. The toolbox provides easy processing and creation of fMRI images. It also provides wrappers that automate cumbersome SPM tasks and provides an interface to FreeSurfer. 

This toolbox is currently in its infancy. Over the course of time I will add more of my functions to it as their documentation becomes ready, and provide some example workflows.
